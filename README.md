# Frontend Friends

*Say hi to your new best friends for frontend development!*

Frontend friends offer a lightweight alternative to massive SPA-libraries. The humble wish is to provide you with a great developer experience as you navigate between declarative views, easy-to-follow state management, two-way bindings, effective list rendering, component authoring and interactive islands. All this with type hints, but without any build step or extra dependencies.
